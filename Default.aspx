New Delhi: It was a rained out morning in Delhi on Wednesday with the season's heaviest showers resulting in several areas being waterlogged and the inevitable traffic snarls. The early morning showers today led to chaos in the city with people wading through knee-deep water in several areas, water seeping into basements and traffic jams on key roads.
