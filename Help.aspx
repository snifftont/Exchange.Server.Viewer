        New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy, Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, and Bharatiya Janata Party's Navjyot Singh Sidhu are among those who barely attended Parliament in the third year of the 15th Lok Sabha.
 </p>
<p>
While Mr Gandhi was present in the Lok Sabha on 24 days out of the 85 sittings it had between May 2011 and May 2012, Mr Yadav fared slightly better by remaining present on 31 days. Mr Sidhu and Mr Kumaraswamy, former Karnataka Chief Minister, attended the Lok Sabha on 16 days.
 </p>
<p>
This was stated in 'Representative at Work' - a report on the third year performance of the 15th Lok Sabha 2011-12 prepared by an NGO 'Mass for Awareness'.
 </p>
<p>
The least attendance (of four days) was recorded by A Raja (DMK) who was jailed in connection with the 2G spectrum scam.
